Joe is wierdly cheerful since the funeral.

On my hovercraft are flying bees, and there's plenty of honey.

By the nuclear power station west of Esteros, pure solitude.

Over the hill

My hovercraft is full of eels

Over the hill yonder I see a moose.

In west philidelphia born and raised - in the playground is where I spent most of my days.
